# Replications-Comparisons-and-Sampling
Code accompanying the paper "Replications, Comparisons, Sampling and the Problem of Representativeness in Animal Cognition "

This code reproduces the simulation results from the paper and outputs Figures 2-5. 

The code was writting in R 4.0.2. 

The code uses the package 'extraFont' to format the Figures. If you have not used 'extraFont' before in R, an additional line of code

> fontimport()

must be run. This is commented out in the current file. See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extrafont/README.html for more information.
